Takes your chef skills down a few notches
It's Big
It was a bit of a disappointment
Not exactly what I was expecting
It's OK but far from perfect.,
Sharp could be Sharper
It's 26 and 1/2 so there was a 1/4 gap on both sides Would look nice if it
Three Stars
Good performance, suspect reliability
Three Stars
Received with damages in the back and on the sides ...
Wouldn't buy again.
Tippy - Be Careful
pad very delicate
Worried how long it will hold up.
Because I was stung by the fatal malfunction of the ...
Shrunk in shipment ...
Door seems not very stable ;(
Your results may vary
I wanted a product that was a microwave and toaster ...
The microwave/oven features are great. Very easy to use and looks great
Ok, but some options are limited and the instructions are somewhat obtuse.
too early to rate the microwave.
Nothing special, but fits the bill.
Came damaged
Danby 1.1 cuft microwave good unit
I like Sharp Microwaves
Perhaps its my fault in not researching the low wattage ...
Does the job. Eventually.
just ok
Cute, affordable and durable.. just weaker wattage ...
Adequate for intended use
A bit noisy when running and the box and unit ...
Satisfactory..
Adequate, but noisy
Micro Micro
Looks and warms great but has a problem with the door closing
OK el cheapo microwave
NO CHOICE IN PURCHASING, ADEQUATE PRODUCT
average microwave
Fine
quiet
I never used this for my wife insisted we buy ...
but it is a little slow and worse of all it has no way to quickly add ...
Three Stars
Does the job, but not Elegant
It's a microwave. The buttons feel cheap. Also ...
Three Stars
No review because it was returned
Also the plate that rotates sticks and makes a horribly loud noise as if something is going to explode
could be a bit larger
Meh
Fair Deal
Three Stars
value for monet
I can't speak to the good qualities it may have
big and bigger
Three Stars
Nice looking microwave
Ok but little
Noisy and hard to open but I needed a smaller ...
it probably works better than the Oster OGB8902-B0
Three Stars
Meh
Really tiny. Not very powerful. Both of those ...
It is a great little machine
OKAY, heats well; interior  vapors accumulate easily.

little experience with device yet. setup and install directions unbelievably bad
Ge Microwave oven magnetron and diode kit
Difficult to Open
Not Pleased First time around - I'll try a second time
Decent
Good and bad
Replaced the same model bought 6 years ago
4/2016 update  - 3 yr lifespan.   nice small microwave
Updated Sharp over the range microwave
good microwave
MICROWAVE CAVITY PAINT 98QBP03
Convection oven still not working
microwave packaging was not strong enough
Not worth the expense
A little big..easy to use.
Good enough
a bit clunky sounding
Not the specified dimensions
It's okay...
Replaced Previous Version
Good Microwave, Loud Fan
What Happened to Sharp Quality?
Good microwave but GE must think it's a disposable.
Good and cheap and it works
Excellent until paint peeled
Pros and Cons after owning one for 6 years
Buy a One Year Warranty Extension
Looks great but lives up to poor reviews
Looks pretty, but function is so-so
LG Microwave
Some unique features, falling apart
Stopped working after 2 months
Oven:  Good.  Installation: Problematic.
It Misses the Point of Being a Multi-Function Appliance
Lack of operating instructions
Looks nice, heats fine, BUT you can't  cook and have timer at same time
Good, but with some surprises
This microwave is noisy.
I want to love this microwave combo oven
Track record not great
Samsung 1.8 cu.ft. otr microwave
Does this run on diesel?
Worked great until the door broke!!
I had also purchased an LG side by side refrigerator which I hate but it works
I'm an IDIOT
good product for the price

Venting to outside
Handle keeps breaking
Very good for the price, with some reservations
Don't even think about it
Gutless
Cheap Handle
Fan malfunctions at random times
IT IS AN OK MICROWAVE FOR MY TINY KITCHEN!
Be careful on installation. Some SS Steel parts magnetic.
Works great, except it does some anoying beeps
steam from stove will ruin it
Love it BUT.....
Adequate Small Microwave

You Can't Separate the Pacifier
yes and no
Wubbanub Pacifier Confetti Puppy
Wrong Item Shipped!!!!!
Wrong item but still very cute!
wrong discription
wrong color sent
Would Recommend for 0-3
would not buy again
would like it more if the fabric was tougher and the giant logo wasn't there
Would be great except for snap
Would be better if you could swap out the Paci it's self
Would be better if it was easy to tie a standard soother ...
worth what i paid
WORTH THE MONEY?
worth a try, but not helping much
Works, but small!
works well, has minor flaws
works great. the visability
works great to track whether your on right and left
works great but unsure about parent safety
Works good if you can get the baby to use it
works fine, but would maybe not purchase again.
Works but junky for price
works better with non-angled windows
works about the same as free drug store dispensers
worked well with my baby, only downside is that ...
Worked but leaked
Work great
Won't take it.
won't stay on the wall.
Won't stay in
wonderful, until it ripped after a couple months
wobbly, scuffed knob
Wish there were nubbies around the nipple
Wish there was a way to remove the pacifier
Wish the pacifier was removable
Will save for later...
Will or won't your baby enjoy this ?
will not stay attached!
Why can't we choose our own colors?
when we installed these to our table with the double ...
when the lock is in the locked position it is ...
When I bought the more traditional pacifiers they work a lot better for us
What a waste of ten bucks
well-designed for purpose, but too big for child's arm
well....
well, first, it didn't stick to the window ...
well my little baby was so happy the board
Well made, but had some issues
well engineered, but there are issues
Weird taste and smell
weird but pretty?
We ordered pink.
we loved this until my son started eating solids
we loved it but my child is extremely messy when eating
We love giraffe and wanted the baby to love this
we like the comfort and ease of use of the econobum ...
Water gets in nipple when washed

Unique and fairly good produce
unimpressed
Unhygienic WubbaNub
undersized
Unable to replace the pacifier
ughh
u really have to get it in the light to ...
two cameras- :(
twigs are okay. stems are better.
Turned out it wasn't a great option for us after all
Trying it out
tried a million baby locks
toxic & not bpa free...
too soft
too small to fit baby book shown in stock photo
Too small for us.
too small
too oxpensive for so small toy but my daughter likes it
too much wing droop for my skinny
Too much $$
Too long
too heavy
too heavy
Too hard for my daughter
TOO HARD
too fussy and tore when i tried to move them
Too flat and creepy on video monitor
Too expensive - can not replace pacifier.
too early
too delicate
too big for my windows, suction cups do not stay attached to window or screen
Too Big
Too big
toddler mats
To each his own...my baby prefers these more as chew toys over pacifiers
Nine dollars in shipping for a six dollar item; better off buying at store.

Elchim Hair Dryer
I like the temperature settings of cool
it is very well made but it is so powerful if drys my hair so fast I can't style it with my round brush for a good blow out
It's not perfect.

Not enough powerful dryer

Good in a pinch
Good value at ~14 bucks for the white one
Great power, Fast drying, but super tangly hair
